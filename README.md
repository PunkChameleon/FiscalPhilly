# FiscalPhilly

A simple node-based twitterbot that regularly tweets out the commodities contract information [from the City of Philadelphia](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/commodity-contract-data).

You can find it live [@FiscalPhilly](http://www.twitter.com/FiscalPhilly).

Built with love and inspiration by [@CodeForPhilly](http://www.twitter.com/CodeForPhilly). Data from [OpenDataPhilly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/commodity-contract-data).

## Contributing

Any and all contributions are welcome. Just fork and PR any fixes and improvements and they'll be readily reviewed! The data, as of now is only from Q1 2016 (already approved), so in order to keep running we'll have to update by the end of the next quarter.
